# 🧑‍💻 1. Introduction to PySpark

## 🔹 What is PySpark?

**PySpark** is the **Python API** for **Apache Spark**, an open-source, distributed computing engine designed for **big data processing** at scale.

- Allows you to write Spark applications using Python.
- Internally uses **Py4J** to connect Python with Spark's JVM core.
- Ideal for processing terabytes/petabytes of data using parallel computing.

## 🔹 Why Use PySpark?

| Feature        | Description                                                                 |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Ease of Use | Write Spark jobs in Python, which is concise, readable, and beginner-friendly |
| ⚡ Speed        | In-memory computation ensures fast processing                               |
| 🌍 Scalability  | Runs on a single machine or across thousands of nodes on a cluster         |
| 📊 Versatility  | Supports batch, real-time, SQL, and ML processing                          |
| 🔗 Integration | Works with HDFS, Hive, Kafka, S3, Snowflake, and more                       |

## 🔹 Spark Ecosystem Overview

| Component       | Description                                          |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Spark Core**   | Manages memory, task scheduling, fault tolerance     |
| **Spark SQL**    | SQL-based querying on structured data                |
| **Spark Streaming** | Real-time data stream processing                  |
| **MLlib**        | Built-in scalable machine learning library           |
| **GraphX**       | API for graph-based computation (JVM only)           |

## 🔹 Spark Architecture Summary

- **Driver Program** – Main process that controls job execution
- **Cluster Manager** – Allocates resources (e.g., YARN, Standalone, Kubernetes)
- **Executors** – JVM processes that run on worker nodes
- **Tasks** – The smallest unit of execution
- **Jobs & Stages** – A job is broken into stages → stages are divided into tasks

> 🧠 PySpark sends your Python code to the JVM backend, which executes tasks in parallel across the cluster.

## 🔹 PySpark vs Pandas

| Feature         | PySpark                         | Pandas                     |
|-----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Scale           | Distributed, cluster-based      | Local, in-memory           |
| Speed           | Fast on large datasets           | Fast on small datasets     |
| Fault Tolerance | Yes (RDD lineage & DAG recovery)| No                         |
| Use Case        | Enterprise big data workflows    | Local analytics, prototyping|
