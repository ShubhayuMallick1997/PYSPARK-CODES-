# 📊 3. RDDs (Resilient Distributed Datasets)

---

## 🔹 What is an RDD?

**RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)** is the **core low-level abstraction** in Apache Spark for working with distributed data.

It is:

* **Immutable** – once created, it cannot be modified
* **Distributed** – stored across multiple nodes in a cluster
* **Lazy Evaluated** – transformations aren’t executed until an action is called
* **Fault-tolerant** – can recover from node failures automatically

> 💡 RDDs were the **original abstraction in Spark**, and though DataFrames and Datasets are now preferred for structured data, RDDs are still powerful and useful for low-level transformations.

---

## 🔹 Creating RDDs

### ✅ From a collection (local data)

```python
data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
rdd = sc.parallelize(data)
```

This creates an RDD from a Python list using the `SparkContext.parallelize()` method.

You can also manually set the number of partitions (slices):

```python
rdd = sc.parallelize(data, numSlices=3)
```

---

### ✅ From an external file

```python
rdd = sc.textFile("s3://mybucket/data/file.txt")
```

This reads a text file (line by line) into an RDD.

* Can be used for files in **HDFS**, **S3**, or local file systems.
* Each line in the file becomes an element in the RDD.

> ⚠️ Use `SparkContext` (`sc`) to create RDDs. In modern PySpark workflows, DataFrames (via `SparkSession`) are typically preferred for structured data.

## 🔹 Transformations in RDD

Transformations are **lazy operations** that define a new RDD from the existing one. These are not executed immediately.

### 🔧 Common Transformations:

#### 1. `map()`

Applies a function to each element and returns a new RDD.

```python
rdd.map(lambda x: x * 2)
```

#### 2. `flatMap()`

Similar to `map()`, but **flattens** the output.

```python
rdd = sc.parallelize(["Hello world", "How are you"])
rdd.flatMap(lambda line: line.split(" "))
# Output: ["Hello", "world", "How", "are", "you"]
```

#### 3. `filter()`

Filters elements based on a condition.

```python
rdd.filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0)
```

> 🔁 Transformations are **chained together** to build a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph), and only executed when an action is called.

---

## 🔹 Actions in RDD

Actions **trigger execution** of the RDD transformations and return results.

### ⚙️ Common Actions:

#### 1. `collect()`

Returns all elements as a list (use with caution on large datasets)

```python
rdd.collect()
```

#### 2. `count()`

Counts the number of elements

```python
rdd.count()
```

#### 3. `reduce()`

Combines elements using a function (e.g., sum)

```python
rdd.reduce(lambda a, b: a + b)
```

#### 4. `first()`, `take(n)`

Returns the first or first `n` elements

```python
rdd.first()
rdd.take(3)
```

## 💤 Lazy Evaluation

Spark uses **lazy evaluation**, meaning:

* Transformations like `map`, `filter`, etc., are **not executed immediately**
* Spark builds a **logical plan (DAG)** of transformations
* Actual execution starts **only when an action** (e.g., `collect()`, `count()`) is called

### ✅ Benefits:

* Optimizations (e.g., pipelining)
* Avoids unnecessary computation
* More efficient resource usage

---

## 🧠 Caching and Persistence

Spark allows you to **cache** RDDs to memory for **reuse**, improving performance when the same RDD is accessed multiple times.

### ✅ `cache()` – Stores RDD in memory

```python
rdd.cache()
```

### ✅ `persist()` – More control (e.g., memory and disk)

```python
from pyspark import StorageLevel
rdd.persist(StorageLevel.MEMORY_AND_DISK)
```

> ⚠️ Caching is essential in iterative algorithms (e.g., ML, graph processing)

## 📊 RDD vs DataFrame

| Feature           | RDD                            | DataFrame                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------- |
| Abstraction Level | Low-level                      | High-level (table-like)       |
| API Language      | Functional (map, reduce, etc.) | SQL-like and DSL              |
| Performance       | Less optimized                 | Catalyst Optimizer (faster)   |
| Use Case          | Complex transformations        | Structured data processing    |
| Serialization     | Java/Pickle                    | Tungsten (efficient binary)   |
| Schema Support    | No schema                      | Schema-based                  |
| Interoperability  | Limited                        | Easy to convert to Pandas/SQL |

> ✅ Use **RDD** when you need full control or are working with **unstructured data**
> ✅ Prefer **DataFrames** for **structured data** and better performance

---

## ✅ Summary

* RDD is Spark’s fundamental data abstraction.
* You can create RDDs from collections or files.
* Transformations are lazy; actions trigger execution.
* Caching improves performance for reused RDDs.
* While RDDs are powerful, DataFrames are recommended for structured, SQL-like data processing.
